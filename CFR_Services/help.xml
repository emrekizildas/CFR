<help>New_Mabako-services V1.0 by XX3!
Original Author: Mabako

To get food, go to the burger, pizza or cluckin bell blip. (it will appear if you are close enough to the building) Go to the counter and choose one of these food. It will restore some health in one click. ;)

To get weapons, go to the ammunation blip, and buy each of the weapons included by going to the counter.
Jetpacks can be used/removed by pressing "J" (If you got freeroam resource loaded, it will run 2 times at once if you pressed J, so you wouldn`t see the jetpack. Solution: Change the bind key)

Pay & Spray will work, but the garages won`t open! Unless if you have a resource to open the garage door.  (I will update it if I can with the open/close garages)

Thanks to Mabako for the original resource.

Coming soon:
The shop has a seller inside the buildings so it will be more realistic.
